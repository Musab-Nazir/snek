# snek
Simple snake game in fennel. Using the [Love framework](https://love2d.org/)

`main.fnl` contains the source code that can be compiled to lua via:
```
fennel --compile main.fnl > main.lua
```
To run the game (assuming you have the love binary installed) on Mac OS I use
```
open -n -a love ~/path/to/main.lua
```
